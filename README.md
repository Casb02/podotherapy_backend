### Docker setup    
If you just want to run the application, you can use the docker-compose file to setup the database and the application.
There are compiled versions in ./devbuilds folder that are regularly updated. (note: that you dont need to run them directly, docker-compose will do it for you)


**1.a** Install docker, you can download docker desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

**1.b** You can also download docker as a apt/homebrew package see commands below (docker-compose is included in docker desktop)
```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
# Mac
brew install docker docker-compose
```

**2.** Run docker-compose, first go to the root of the project (here is the compose.yml located) and then run the following command 
```bash
# Ubuntu / Mac / Docker Desktop
docker-compose up
```

**3.a** With docker desktop you can see all the running containers in the dashboard, you can also see the logs of the containers there.

**3.b** If you are using the command line you can see the running containers with the following command
```bash

**4.** You can stop the containers with the following command
```bash
docker-compose down
```

**5.** The CLI offers for both desktop and the base cli (wich is included in docker desktop) the following commands

# List all images (images are the base for containers)
docker images
